# Observability POC

This project serves as a proof of concept for implementing observability practices in modern applications. Observability helps us understand the internal state of our systems through collecting, analyzing, and utilizing different types of telemetry data.

## Labs

- [Lab 1: Basic Instrumentation](./lab-1) - Introduction to basic instrumentation concepts and implementation

## Core Observability Pillars

This project demonstrates the three main pillars of observability:

### 1. Metrics
- Quantitative measurements over time
- System and application performance indicators
- Resource usage statistics
- Business metrics

### 2. Logs
- Detailed event records
- Error tracking
- Audit trails
- Debug information

### 3. Traces
- Request flows through distributed systems
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Service dependencies
- End-to-end transaction monitoring

## Project Structure

Each lab in this project focuses on different aspects of observability implementation, providing hands-on examples and best practices for:

- Instrumentation
- Data collection
- Visualization
- Alerting
- Analysis

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Follow the README instructions in each lab directory
3. Start with [Lab 1](./lab-1) for basic instrumentation concepts

## Technologies Used

- OpenTelemetry
- Prometheus
- Grafana
- Jaeger
- Elasticsearch
- Kibana
